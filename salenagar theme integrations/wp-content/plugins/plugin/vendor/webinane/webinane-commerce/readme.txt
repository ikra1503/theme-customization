### WP Commerce Basics

After the activation of the plugin, you’ll have to create some pages and place the following shortcodes:


- My Account `[wpcm_my_account]`  
- Checkout `[wpcm_checkout]`  
- Order Results `[wpcm_order_success]`  


You can add the following code manually where you want to show the "Add to Cart" button.


`<?php echo do_shortcode('[wpcm_add_to_cart_button item_id="POST_ID" quantity="1" price="20" class="btn"]Add to Cart[/wpcm_add_to_cart_button]'); ?>`



Replace **POST_ID**  with post, page or custom post ID.

After creating the above pages you'll have to select these pages from WP Commerce Settings > Display Settings.



WP Commerce comes with PayPal Standard gateway to accept the payments. If you are looking for more gateways then visit https://webinane.com . 

You'll have to fill out all the fields require for PayPal Standard, so it works smoothly.
