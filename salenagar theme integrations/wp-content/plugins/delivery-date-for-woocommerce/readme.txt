== Advanced Option ==

1.	Admin can manage the label of the delivery date field.

2.  We also made some advancement by allowing admin to select date/days range as per his convenience. It can be customize by 
	1.	Selecting particular days (Saturday, Sunday etc.)
	2.	Selecting particular Dates (25th December, 31st December etc)
	3.	Disabling days from the order date.
	
3.	Admin can disable particular dates for delivery(For example on 25th December), so customer cannot select those dates for order delivery.

4.	Admin can disable some days (For example Saturday, Sunday), then it will be disabled on frontend so the customer cannot select that day for order delivery.
